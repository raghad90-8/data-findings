# My findings in TMDb Movie Dataset
## by Raghad alonazie

## Dataset


For my project, I have chosen to work with the TMDb Movies dataset from this link https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata. This is a large dataset that stores information about most popular (and also less popular) movies such as:

- **popularity:** This is a measure of a movie's popularity.

- **vote count:** The number of votes a given movie has received.

- **vote average:** This is the average rating of a given movie.

- **budget_adj:** This is the adjusted budget of a given movie. This takes into account the inflation factor of currency.

- **revenue_adj:** This is the adjusted revenue of a given movie. This takes into account the inflation factor of currency.

The main data wrangling and cleaning steps I performed are:

1- dropping unneeded variables.
2- removing null values.
3- removing rows with non-sensical values.
4- converting some numerical variables to categorical (such as vote averages).
5- replacing some outlier values of popularity with more reasonable values.

## Summary of Findings

In a nutshell, the main findings conveyed by the following slides show that movies with small budgets can be popular and be rated as well as movies with higher budgets. This is good news for amateurs and producers who do not have access to big budgets since they can still be successful as big produces and get high revenues.> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Here are the key questions from my explorations that will be highlighted in my presentation:

1- How a movie's budget affects  it rating?

2- How a movie's revenue affects  it rating?

3 - What is the relationship between budget, revenue and popularity?


I hope you enjoy my presentation.
